# Go GraphQL Address API

This project is a GraphQL API built with Go that serves address data. It was created as a learning exercise to explore GraphQL server development in Go, including database migration, testing, and authentication with API keys.

---

## ‚ú® Features

- **GraphQL API:** Exposes address data through a clean GraphQL interface.
- **SQLite Database:** Uses a local SQLite database for data persistence.
- **Database Migration:** Includes a script to migrate data from JSON files into the database.
- **Authentication:** Protects specific queries using an API key and GraphQL directives.
- **Repository Pattern:** Separates database logic from the API layer for clean architecture.
- **Integration & Unit Tests:** Includes tests for both the repository (with a real in-memory DB) and the resolvers (with mocks).
- **Dockerized:** Comes with a `Dockerfile` for easy containerization and deployment.
